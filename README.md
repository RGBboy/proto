## Ideas

* Hatching, lines to describe shape and form.
  * 3D shape with normals, points added then convex hulls calculated.
    Per hull, average normal and use to determine stroke direction.
* Cube from Three mixed with dots from Five. Use dots to describe shape.
* Negative space. Absence of lines to describe form.
